Project: Simple client-side marketplace demo

This repository is a small single-page application (no backend). Key files:
- `index.html` — app shell and DOM templates (`card-template`, `gallery-image-template`).
- `app.js` — all application logic (routing, rendering, localStorage persistence, FileReader image uploads).
- `styles.css` — styling (BEM-like classes such as `page__header`, `btn--ghost`).
- `docker-compose.yml` — static server using `nginx:alpine` mapping host `8080` → container `80`.

Big picture
- This is a pure frontend SPA using hash-based routing (`#/`, `#/new`, `#/ad?id=...`) defined in `app.js`'s `routes` object.
- All data is stored in the browser `localStorage` (no external APIs). Main storage keys: `usedmarket_ads_v1` and `usedmarket_theme` (see top of `app.js`).
- Images are stored as Data URLs (Base64) created by `FileReader` and kept in `localStorage` alongside ads.

How to run locally (no build step)
- Quick (file): open `index.html` in a browser for a basic preview.
- Lightweight server: from repository root run `python -m http.server 8000` and open `http://localhost:8000`.
- Docker (serves site via nginx):
  - Start: `docker-compose up -d`
  - Stop: `docker-compose down`
  - After start open `http://localhost:8080`.

What to change and where (project-specific guidance)
- If you change a DOM `id` or template name in `index.html` (for example `card-template`), update the corresponding `document.getElementById` or `querySelector` usage in `app.js`.
- Routing is hash-based — update the `routes` map at the top of `app.js` and the `render()` dispatcher when adding/removing pages.
- When editing storage format: update the `STORAGE_KEY` constant and add migration logic inside `loadAds()` to avoid data loss for existing users.
- Avoid adding a frontend framework without also adding the build tooling and `package.json`. This project intentionally uses vanilla JS and works without a build step.

Patterns and conventions to follow
- UI uses small, focused functions (e.g., `renderHome`, `renderNewAd`, `renderAdDetails`) — prefer this pattern when adding new views.
- Accessibility: keyboard handlers and ARIA attributes are present (e.g., `article` keyboard handling in `renderHome`). Preserve keyboard behavior when refactoring.
- Styling: class names resemble BEM (`block__elem--modifier`). Keep that style when naming classes.

Quick code pointers (search these to find relevant areas)
- Routes: search for `routes = {` in `app.js`.
- Storage keys: search for `STORAGE_KEY` and `THEME_KEY`.
- Templates: look for `card-template` and `gallery-image-template` inside `index.html`.

Integration points and external dependencies
- There are no runtime external services. The only integration is optional Docker-based static serving (`nginx`).

Editing checklist for PRs
- Run locally by opening `index.html` or with `docker-compose up -d`.
- If you change the storage schema, include migration or bump the `STORAGE_KEY` to avoid corrupting user data.
- Update any template `id`s both in `index.html` and `app.js`.
- Keep changes in plain JS/CSS/HTML unless you add build tooling and update README/CI accordingly.

Notes
- This file was generated by scanning `app.js`, `index.html`, and `docker-compose.yml`. If you'd like more detail (example PR template, tests, or CI), tell me which area to document next.

Questions for you
- Anything missing or unclear? Should I add a short PR checklist or example dev commands to `README.md`?
